# Alien Encounters ðŸ›¸ - Visualizing UFO Sightings

Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) have long captured our collective imagination, inspiring countless stories, debates, and questions about the unknown. In this era of data-driven exploration, we have a unique opportunity to delve into the world of UFO sightings using a comprehensive dataset. The [UFO sightings Dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-06-20) was taken from the TidyTuesday project. This dataset compiles a treasure trove of reports, encompassing not just descriptions of UFO encounters, but also their temporal, spatial, and qualitative dimensions. Our journey through this dataset begins with an exploration of its provenance and dimensions, setting the stage for a systematic analysis aimed at unraveling the mysteries of UFO sightings. Through this report, we embark on an intellectual adventure to reveal the temporal and spatial patterns, examine correlations, and open the door to a world where the unexplained meets data-driven discovery.
